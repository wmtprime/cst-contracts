# Cashiva Tokens

Cashiva Standard Token (CST) are cryptocurrency-backed tokens operating on the Ethereum blockchain, featuring a unique dynamic exchange rate fixation. Each token is issued according to a specific currency pair, where the token value is denominated in fiat currency and collateralized by cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.). With every transaction, the exchange rate is fixed via a trusted oracle, ensuring transparent and up-to-date determination of the asset's real value.
